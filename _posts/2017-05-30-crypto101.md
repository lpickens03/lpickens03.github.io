Like any good crypto class or book, I will begin with Alice and Bob (see <a href="//web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/alice-and-bob">here</a> for an amusing perspective on Alice and Bob's sordid affairs). Alice wants to send a message to Bob, but she is concerned that someone (in this case Eve) will overhear her conversation. So she encrypts the plaintext of her message with a special key and the sends the resulting ciphertext to Bob. Bob also happens to have a special key which he can then use with a decryption algorithm to decrypt the ciphertext, transforming it back to the original plaintext. Thus, when Eve attempts to listen in on the conversation between Alice and Bob, all she gets is the ciphertext. Without the decryption algorithm and the key, the ciphertext is useless to her (in theory). The trick here is that the key(s) used for encrypting and decrypting communications must be shared over a secure channel and the ciphertext itself must not provide any hints as to what the original plaintext might be. A figure showing Alice's communication channel to Bob as well as the formal notation for this system is below.

<span class="notation">
$$P$$ is a finite set of possible plaintexts, $$x \in P$$<br/>
$$C$$ is a finite set of possible ciphertexts, $$y \in C$$<br/>
$$K$$ is the finite set of possible keys, $$k \in K$$<br/>
For each $$k \in K$$, there is an encryption rule $$e_k \in E$$ and a corresponding decryption rule $$d_k \in D$$. Each $$e_k : P \rightarrow C$$ and $$d_k : C \rightarrow P$$ are functions such that $$d_k(e_k(x)) = x$$ for every $$x \in P$$.

The various encryption methods used today can be broken into types based on what type of key (symmetric keys vs asymmetric keys) is being used and what type of input data (block ciphers vs stream ciphers) it is taking.
