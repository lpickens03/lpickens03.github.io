I originally picked up this book because the Stinson book (<i>Cryptography Theory and Practice</i>, 2006) that seems to be the defacto book for most crypto classes is heavy on the math and light on the explanation. This book proved to be a great supplement to Stinson, offering the high level overview of concepts that Stinson often glosses over with an over abundance of math formulas. Since Easttom specifically designed this book for people with little math background (or like me hasn't touched math since undergrad), he takes the time to explain the history and mathematical concepts behind each encryption technique. His explanations are concise and easy to understand and he sprinkles enough fun facts to keep the writing interesting. 

My only complaint is that he has the opposite problem of Stinson, glossing over a lot of the math in exchange for exposition. So there were several times where Easttom didn't dig deep enough into a concept for me to really grasp it (-ahem- cryptanalysis -ahem-) and I was forced to scour the internet for more comprehensive answers. Overall, though, this book really helped me through my cryptology class. I would caution that Easttom uses different terminology for a lot of the same concepts than Stinson. So if you are using this book as a supplement to Stinson and your professor is an ardent Stinson aficionado, you will have to spend extra time translating between the two. Honestly, Easttom's terms were easier for me to wrap my head around so I was grateful for the alternative lingo. I think for anyone looking for a great overview of crytography without too deep of a dive into more advanced concepts, this is a great book for you.
