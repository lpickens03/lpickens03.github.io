While electrical engineering and physics are two fields I have little formal education in, I've always enjoyed learning more about them, especially as they pertain to computers. So I picked up <i>The Chip</i> with the hopes of learning more about the inner workings of microchips as well as the people who helped create what is arguably the greatest invention of the 20th century. I was not disappointed. <i>The Chip</i> managed to find a good balance between the technical and the narrative to craft an engaging story. While there were some missed opportunities to dive deeper into the technical, the primary goal of this book was to offer a historical perspective on the evolution of a critical piece of technology and to that it definitely delivered.

<i>The Chip</i> follows two men, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of then Noyce Company, in a race to develop, patent, and monetize a solution the "tyranny of numbers" problem that was plaguing electronics at the time (see <a href=""> </a>). In 1959, both of these men, only a few months apart came to the same conclusion that would lead to the birth of the microchip: connecting multiple devices on a single piece of silicon in order to make interconnections part of the manufacturing process to drasticlly reduce the cost, weight and size of each element.
