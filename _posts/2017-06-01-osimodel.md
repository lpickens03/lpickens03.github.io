No networking class is complete without dragging out the good old Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. The OSI model abstracts network communications into seven separate layers. Each layer (in theory) hides their inner workings from the others while performing some critical function. <strong>It is important to note that this is a "model" meaning many protocols/real world network implementations do not fit neatly into each layer.</strong> If you are interested in some of the history surrounding the OSI model, check out <a href="/research/2017/06/01/arpanet/">my other post on ARPANET</a>.
