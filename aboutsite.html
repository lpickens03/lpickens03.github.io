<div class="container">
  <h1 class="error-title">About this site</h1>
  <p> This site has borrowed from the following themes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/">Freelancer</a>, a free bootstrap theme created by Start Bootstrap</li>
  <li><a href="http://themes.jekyllrc.org/lanyon/">Lanyon</a>, a Jekyll theme</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Obviously these themes have been heavily modified, merged and gutted, but credit where credit's due for giving me a great jumpstart in Bootstrap and Jekyll.</p>
  <p> This site also uses free icons from <a href="https://icons8.com/">Icons8</a>.</p>
