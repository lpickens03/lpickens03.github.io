<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
I am a constant work-in-progress. This blog is a way for me to document my research, projects and experiences for my own personal reference. While my primary focus will be on information security related topics, I reserve the right to stray off course whenever the mood hits. You have been warned. 

<br/>
<h2>About Me</h2>
My background is in developing tools, applications and scripts to help make  people's jobs easier. I've spent a lot of time working in a fast-paced environment that required me to learn about a variety of operating systems, networking configurations, software and programming languages on the fly to monitor and debug systems, integrate tools and automate time-consuming tasks. I moonlighted as a system administrator for a while before spending a few years in C++/C# application development. Until, of course, I realized cybersecurity was where my passions truly lie and steered my career in a new direction.

I currently work for a government contractor, assessing customer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities as well as supporting in-depth vulnerability testing of customer systems.

In my free time, when not working on my Master's, certifications or home lab projects, I enjoy reading, exploring the world of astronomy and savoring whatever good food and wine come my way.
