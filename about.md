<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
This site is a way for me to document my research, projects and experiences for my own personal reference. While my primary focus will be on information security related topics, I may stray off course whenever the mood hits. 

<h2>About Me</h2>
As a relatively recent convert to InfoSec, I am a firm believer in building your knowledgebase in the fundamentals of computer science, networking and, yes, program management in order to succeed in this field. Without a holistic approach to security, you will hit wall after wall as you build your career. This is what attracted me to this field to begin with: I had a thirst to understand how <i>everything</i> works. 

Before InfoSec, I spent a few years as a system administrator and then another few as a software engineer. I am currently a cybersecurity analyst for a government contractor. I assess customer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities as well as support in-depth penetration testing of customer systems.
